This project was done with the main interest of creating and implementing a REST API to communicate two client-side applications (one for readers and the other for blog owner, both made with React) and the server (Express). The application employs the passport package and the JWT method to provide the owner with authentication and to grant access to operations that involve the creation and edition of posts and comments.
